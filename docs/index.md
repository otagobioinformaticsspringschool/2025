# About

Bioinformatics Spring School 2025 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by Genomics Aotearoa and Research Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ).

We will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops (influenced by The Carpentries), covering example bioinformatic workflows. The exact topics will be decided by the organisers based on submitted Expression of Interests.

This event is organised by:

### Cost? 

This event itself will only cost your time (there isn't a $ charge) and lunches will be provided. Attendees will need to fund all other travel related expenses.

This is an in-person event.



## Schedule so far:

Day one and two of the week set:

Monday:

- Introduction to an HPC environment
- Introduction to Unix Shell

Tuesday:

- Introduction to Genomic Variant Calling
    - Common genomic data formats
    - an example variant calling pipeline using common tools


## Potential Topics to be included


!!! info
    This year we're trialling something different, instead of us deciding in advance the topics, we're instead putting to a vote which topics would be a priority for you. The full schedule will then try to cater the best it can to the selected participants.

Each of the following links to existing workshops in the GA training catalogue and based on demand we can incorporate into the week. For multi-day workshops the content would be abridged to fit a day.

- [Introduction to RNAseq](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/RNA-seq-data-analysis-workflow/)
- [Introduction to Long Read Assembly](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/long-read-assembly-one-day/)
- [Introduction to R for data analysis](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Introduction-to-R/)
- [Intermediate R](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Intermediate-R/)
- [Intermediate Shell for Bioinformatics](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/shell-for-bioinformatics/)
- [Introduction to Reproduciblity with Quarto](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/reproducibility_with_git_and_quarto/quarto_overview.html)
- [Introduction to Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- [Introduction to workflow pipelines with Nextflow](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/introduction-to-nextflow/)


## I'm interested! How do I apply?

The Otago Bioinformatics Spring School is a popular event but we have a limited number of places to offer. To keep the process as fair as possible and not 'who got the email first' we invite you to fill in an Expression of interest. Expressions of interest will open very shortly and close late September. The organisers will then select applicants to invite to attend with emails being sent about a week after expressions of interest close.

    The workshop content is (mostly) available to look through already if you follow the links above to the existing workshops.
