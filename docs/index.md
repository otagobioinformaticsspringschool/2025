# About

!!! tip
    Expressions of interest have closed for 2025 and successful applicants have been emailed.

Bioinformatics Spring School 2025 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by Genomics Aotearoa (GA) and Research Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ).

We will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops (influenced by The Carpentries), covering example bioinformatic workflows. The exact topics will be decided by the organisers based on submitted Expression of Interests.

This event is organised by:

<!-- ## Potential Topics to be included -->


<!-- !!! info
    This year we're trialling something different, instead of us deciding in advance the topics, we're instead putting to a vote which topics would be a priority for you. The full schedule will then try to cater the best it can to the selected participants.

Each of the following links to existing workshops in the GA training catalogue and based on demand we can incorporate into the week. For multi-day workshops the content would be abridged to fit a day.

- [Introduction to RNAseq](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/RNA-seq-data-analysis-workflow/)
- [Introduction to Long Read Assembly](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/long-read-assembly-one-day/)
- [Introduction to R for data analysis](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Introduction-to-R/)
- [Intermediate R](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Intermediate-R/)
- [Intermediate Shell for Bioinformatics](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/shell-for-bioinformatics/)
- [Introduction to Reproduciblity with Quarto](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/reproducibility_with_git_and_quarto/quarto_overview.html)
- [Introduction to Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- [Introduction to workflow pipelines with Nextflow](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/introduction-to-nextflow/)

## I'm interested! How do I apply?

Expressions of interest have closed for 2025.

<!-- 
The Otago Bioinformatics Spring School is a popular event but we have a limited number of places to offer. To keep the process as fair as possible and not 'who got the email first' we invite you to fill in an Expression of interest. 

- Expressions of interest will close midnight 30 September
- Applications are open to those residing in New Zealand
- Selected applicants will be emailed about a week after expressions of interest close.

**[FILL IN THIS FORM TO APPLY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPwy1gJIebABxq-N0p4BHTb8IF2l9FLwC61Xcs2iYShDm-BA/viewform?usp=dialog)** -->
