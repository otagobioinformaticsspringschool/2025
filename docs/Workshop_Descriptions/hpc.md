# Introduction to an HPC Environment

We'll be making use of the REANNZ high performance compute (HPC) for researchers, to run our analysis and as part of this we'll cover:

- What is HPC? 
- Logging onto a remote computer
- Transfer of data to/from a remote computer
- What is a job scheduler and how to use it?
- How to request a project allocation on NeSI
